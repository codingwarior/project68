        <p>The motto of The Shri Ram School is “Vidya Dadaati Vinayam” – from knowledge comes humility.  The Shri Ram Schools are progressive, secular, child centred, co-educational private schools, committed to providing quality education for all their students. The philosophy rests on the interpretation of ‘education’ as drawing forth – drawing forth what already exists. The Shri Ram Schools impart education that results in well-formed minds and the impetus and environment to think.  The cornerstone of the philosophy of the school is the belief in each and every child, manifested in a school calendar encompassing the academic and the co-curricular offering opportunities for fostering diverse interests.  Inclusive Education is a pairing of philosophy and pedagogy with the aim of ensuring that no child, however different from expectations and general norms, feels alienated and inadequate. Each child must feel confident of himself or herself and his or her abilities and capacities as well as respected and wanted for what he or she is and therefore safe and secure. With this comes learning and developing, taking into account differences in strengths and shortcomings. Children of The Shri Ram School are sensitised to accept and respect differences. This gives all children a chance to grow as individuals and to realise their own potential and to reach their goals. My Honest Review about TSRS-Tsrs is the best school ever because the teachers are very sweet and make your learning experience very memorable. The motto of Tsrs is vidya dadati vinyam, meaning[Education leads to sensibility, sensibility attains character/qualification, from that comes wealth and from wealth (one does) good deeds, from that (comes) joy]There are 7 grades in the junior campus and 7 in the senior campus. We can Join many tournaments related to sports and studies too.     The core values of the Shri Ram school are- Integrity, Sensitivity, pride in one's heritage and pursuit of excellence.</p>
